Project Description:

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) uses a variety of factors and data to determine interest rates in Australia. Some of the key factors that the RBA considers include:
•	Inflation (CPI) 
•	Economic growth (GDP) 
•	International economic conditions (exchange rates and commodities)
•	Financial stability (bank interest rates and unemployment)


Research questions to answer:

•	How the variables in these 4 factors influence the RBA cash rate decision?
•	Which one of these factors is the biggest influencer for the cash rate? 
•	Which of these factors has positive influence and/or negative influence to the cash rate?
•	What will be the future cash rate based on these 4 factors?

Datasets to be used:

•	RBA cash rate dataset
•	RBA monthly CPI dataset
•	RBA quarterly GDP dataset
•	RBA monthly exchange rate dataset
•	RBA commodities dataset
•	Commbank Standard variable rate (principal and interest rate) dataset
•	Unemployment job data dataset

Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
•	Data clean-up for each csv files (date column to be standardised in all dataset)
•	Merge all data into 1 csv file
•	Generate trends and visualisation to answer the research questions
•	Perform regression analysis to try to predict the next cash rate
